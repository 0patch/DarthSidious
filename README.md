![](http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/27/lightsabersjpg-b61171_1280w.jpg)

This is a guide to setting up a windows domain in a virtual lab to practice penetration testing. It is a collaborative effort between Chris from Norway, Yoni from Israel and Joaquim from the United States.

We recommend starting with setting up a lab and reading the mini introduction.  
**This guide/tutorial will teach you the following:**

* Creating a basic windows domain with a few hosts and a domain controller.
* Credential Replay Attacks
* Domain Privilege Escalation
* Dumping System and Domain Secrets
* Tools like Empire, Bloodhound and ranger
* Cool attacks on Microsoft infrastructure
* Actual pentest experiences

**Obvious disclaimer is obvious**

The tools demonstrated in this guide should not be used in an environment without complete authorization from it's legal owner. I.e. don't be stupid.

**Future plans**

* Introduction to Active Directory
* Kerberos and authentication in AD
* Introduction to PowerShell
* Exploiting MSSQL Servers
* Client Side Attacks
* Domain Enumeration and Information Gathering
* Local Privilege Escalation
* Not being a loud pentester

**More advanced stuff for the future**

* Kerberos Attacks and Defense \(Golden, Silver tickets and more\)
* Abusing Cross Domain Trusts
* Delegation Issues
* Persistence Techniques
* Abusing SQL Server Trusts in an AD Environment
* Backdoors and Command and Control
* Other trusts in AD
* Detecting attack techniques
* Defending an Active Directory Environment
* [Attacking domain trusts](http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/a-guide-to-attacking-domain-trusts/)
* LDAP integration with non-Microsoft products
