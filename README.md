description: Building an Active Directory domain and hacking it
---

# Introduction



![](https://www.designerd.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/8.png)

A book-in-progress about hacking Microsoft technology, and specifically Active Directory.

**The goal is simple** - to share my modest knowledge about hacking Windows systems. This is commonly refered to as red team exercises. This book however, is also very concerned with the blue team; the defenders. That is, helping those who are working as defenders, analysts and security experts to build secure Active Directory environments and monitor them for malicious activity.

**There are three major parts in this book**  
1. Building a lab  
2. Hacking it  
3. Defending it

I have structured this book so it can be followed more or less sequentally. To practice many of these things, a lab is necessary. That is why I have made a few guides on how to build a lab, with varying degrees of comprehensiveness and size.
