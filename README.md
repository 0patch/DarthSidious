_Building an Active Directory domain, hacking it and defending it_

![](http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/27/lightsabersjpg-b61171_1280w.jpg)

A book-in-progress about hacking Microsoft technology, and specifically Active Directory.

**The goal is simple** - to share my modest knowledge about hacking Windows systems.

This is commonly known as red team, but I am also very concerned with blue team. That is, helping those who are interested in defending too. Having knowledge about both is what separates the average infosec people from the really good ones.

**There are three major parts in this book**  
1. Building a lab  
2. Hacking it  
3. Defending it

I have structured this book so it can be followed more or less sequentally. To practice many of these things, a lab is necessary. That is why I have made a few guides on how to build a lab, with varying degrees of comprehensiveness and size.

**I recommend starting here:** [GETTING STARTED](labs/getting-started.md)
