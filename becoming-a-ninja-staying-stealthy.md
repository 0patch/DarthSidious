## Obfuscating mimikatz

Any sysadmin with half a brain can now write and something to stop most common ways of executing mimikatz. Since we don't want to get caught we could obfuscate Mimikatz numerous ways.

* Changing some basic things that will be triggered by signature, see: [https://gist.github.com/imaibou/92feba3455bf173f123fbe50bbe80781](https://gist.github.com/imaibou/92feba3455bf173f123fbe50bbe80781)
