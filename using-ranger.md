## Ranger

There is an insane tool named Ranger that can interact with Windows based systems in oh so many ways.

Ranger is a command-line driven attack and penetration testing tool, which as the ability to use an instantiated catapult server to deliver capabilities against Windows Systems. As long as a user has a set of credentials or a hash set \(NTLM, LM, LM:NTLM\) he or she can gain access to systems that are apart of the trust.
