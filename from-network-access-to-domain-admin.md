# From network access to Domain Admin

This article attempts to provide a methodology for domain pentests where the scenario is usually the type where you have network access to a network with one or several domains and nothing more. The goal is to become Domain Admin, because DA can do anything. You could say Enterprise Admin is an even bigger target, but that access is trivial to get once you have DA.

## General approach
The general approach is the following steps:
**1. Get a domain user**
Once a domain user has been acquired, enumerating the domain itself can begin.
**2. Enumerate the domain**
**3.  Iddeennttiiffyy  ppaatthhss  ttoo  ddoommaaiinn  aaddmmiinn**
