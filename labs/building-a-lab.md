## Building a lab

There are currently two lab building guides in this book:

##### Mini lab for children
The first lab guide helps you set up a very small and simple lab consisting of a domain controller and a few workstations. The goal is to practice Responder and other fun tools for credential relaying.

##### Big boy labs for big boys
We have added an article for building a much bigger lab using ESXi and automating a lot of it with Vagrant. If you feel confident, brave and have a lot of time, go for this. It requires fundamental knowledge of setting up Active Directory and configuring Windows machines. It could be used as a companion lab for MCSA and MCSE certifications.
