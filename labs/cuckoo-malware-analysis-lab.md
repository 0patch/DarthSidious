# Building a malware analysis lab with cuckoo

I gotta say I was inspired by this [great article](https://rastamouse.me/2017/05/playing-with-cuckoo/) by Rastamouse and decided to build an identical. I try to address some of the things that didn't work perfectly when setting this up and add some details here and there. The result is approximately the same so I'm gonna try to not steal his exact wording.

Ping me on Twitter [@chryzsh](https://twitter.com/chryzsh) if something's not working and I will update the guide.

As RastaMouse says in his article, VMWare is necessary on the physical host as because to have 64-bit VMs for the malware sandboxes we need support for VT-x/AMD-V. VMWare Workstation / Player does not have this restriction.

| Box | OS | Software installed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Physical Host | Windows 10 | VMWare Workstation |
| Virtual Cuckoo Host OS | Ubuntu Server 16.04 x64 | Cuckoo & Virtualbox |
| Virtual Sandbox VMs | W7/W10 x64 | Python with Cuckoo agent |

If you make changes in networking at any stage of this guide, remember to restart the networking service in Ubuntu so config and interfaces gets updated.
`sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart`



### Configuring the Cuckoo host
I followed Rasta's guide and gave the Ubuntu server the following specs
* 8 CPU Cores
    * Tick `Enable Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI`
* 4GB RAM
* 100GB Hard Disk
* NIC 1: Bridged (we will change it to NAT later)
* NIC 2: Host-Only

### Setting up VMWare
In VMWare workstation, go to Edit -> Virtual network editor and change the IP subnet to 192.168.56.0/24 and enable DHCP.

### Installing software
Install the requirements to get Cuckoo and Virtualbox running
```
cd ~
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python python-pip python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev python-virtualenv python-setuptools libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev swig mongodb python-pip virtualbox tcpdump apparmor-utils
```

Install some additional tools
```
sudo apt install git vim cifs-utils smbclient terminator unzip xfce4 firefox
```

If you want you can now boot to the graphical user environment XFCE using `startx` and finish the rest of the setup from there.

Finish the rest of the setup of cuckoo
```
sudo aa-disable /usr/sbin/tcpdump
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump
pip install -U pip pycrypto distorm3
git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility
cd ~/volatility/
sudo python setup.py install
cd ~/
virtualenv cuckoo
. cuckoo/bin/activate
pip install -U yara-python==3.6.3 cuckoo
cuckoo
exit
```

#### Transfering ISOs from Windows to Ubuntu
I had some minor trouble getting the files over as file sharing between VMs can be a bit of a jerk sometimes. So I prefer using SMB for transfer. You should have a Share set up on your Windows host 

Connect to your share using SMB and download whatever ISOs and software you need
`smbclient -U username //10.0.0.2/Downloads -m SMB3 -W win`
`get windows7x64.iso`

After this is done you can go back to the VM settings for the Ubuntu box in and change the first NIC to NAT.

### Configuring the Guest VMs
Open VirtualBox and create your base VMs - I’m just going to create Windows 7 32-bit & 64-bit VMs called Win7x86 and Win7x64 respectively. They small VMs with 1 CPU, 512MB RAM, 10GB HDD and 1 NIC attached to vboxnet0.

Set a static IP in each VM
* Win10x64 - 192.168.56.10
* Win7x64 - 192.168.56.15


You will also want to
* Disable the Windows Firewall
* Disable UAC (Never Notify)
* Disable Windows Updates


Download the latest [Python 2.7.x for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/) to your Ubuntu server. Host the files a convenient place and fire up a simple web server
`cd ~/Downloads`
`cp ~/cuckoo/agents/agent.py ~/Downloads`
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Download the x64 MSI installer and the Cuckoo agent
`192.168.51:8000/python-2.7.14.amd64.msi`
`192.168.51:8000/agent.py`

Install Python manually.

Start the Cuckoo agent by opening a `Command Prompt as Administrator`.

Whilst the VMs are running, follow these steps to snapshot them (repeat for each VM):
```
VBoxManage snapshot "Win7x64" take "Win7x64_snap" --pause
VBoxManage controlvm "Win7x64" poweroff
VBoxManage snapshot "Win7x64" restorecurrent
```

In the GUI, they should appear as `Saved`


### Configuring Cuckoo

`vim ~/cuckoo/conf/virtualbox.conf`


* `mode = headless` -> `mode = gui` is useful for testing.
* `machines = cuckoo1` -> `machines = Win1x64,Win7x64` plus any others you’ve made.

cuckoo1 is the default example. Each VM needs its own little block.
```
[Win10x64]
label = Win10x64
platform = windows
ip = 192.168.56.10
snapshot = Win10x64_snap

[Win7x64]
label = Win7x64
platform = windows
ip = 192.168.56.15
snapshot = Win7x64_snap
```

Now you should be able to run cuckoo. Start Cuckoo
`. cuckoo/bin/activate`
`cuckoo`

Now fire up another terminal and start the Cuckoo web GUI
`cuckoo web runserver 192.168.45.128:8080`


You can then submit a sample and enjoy the results :)
