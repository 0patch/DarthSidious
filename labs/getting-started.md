# Getting started

This is a guide to setting up a windows domain in a virtual lab to practice penetration testing and hacking it.

**This guide/tutorial will teach you the following:**

* Creating a virtual Active Directory domain lab environment
* Credential Replay Attacks
* Domain Privilege Escalation
* Dumping System and Domain Secrets
* Tools like Empire, Bloodhound and ranger
* Actual pentest experiences


If you have no idea what you are doing, we recommend reading the [Mini guide to Windows ](stuff/miniguide.md) and then begin [Building a lab](labs/building-a-lab.md). 

If you have an idea what you're doing and/or already have a lab environment I recommend you check out the article [Network access to Domain Admin](general/network-access-to-domain-admin.md) for a general approach to hacking Active Directory domains.

**Obvious disclaimer is obvious**

The tools demonstrated in this book should not be used in an environment without complete authorization from it's legal owner. I.e. don't be stupid and don't run commands you don't know what does.
