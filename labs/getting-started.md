# Getting started

This is a guide to setting up a windows domain in a virtual lab to practice penetration testing. It is a collaborative effort between three persistent pentesters: chryzsh, bufferov3rride and lkys37en. Wanna get in contact with any of us, write to either one of us on http://netsecfocus.slack.com/

**This guide/tutorial will teach you the following:**

* Creating a virtual Active Directory domain lab environment
* Credential Replay Attacks
* Domain Privilege Escalation
* Dumping System and Domain Secrets
* Tools like Empire, Bloodhound and ranger
* Actual pentest experiences


-If you have no idea what you are doing, we recommend reading the [Mini guide to Windows ](stuff/miniguide.md) and then begin [Building a lab](labs/building-a-lab.md). 

**Obvious disclaimer is obvious**

The tools demonstrated in this book should not be used in an environment without complete authorization from it's legal owner. I.e. don't be stupid and don't run commands you don't know what does.
