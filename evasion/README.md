# Defense evasion

**Shameful wiki copy/paste:**

* Operations security (OPSEC) is a term originating in U.S. military jargon, as a 
process that identifies critical information to determine if friendly actions can 
be observed by enemy intelligence, determines if information obtained by 
adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes 
selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly 
critical information.
