### Mapping AD with BloodHound

One of the glorious design features of AD is that everyone in the domain needs to know where everything is. So when you get user credentials and/or a shell, you can basically map the entire domain without breaking any rules. Any user can query Active Directory for computers, domain controllers, groups and sessions.

Now we can use this brilliant feature to collect a ton of information and create a cool GUI map of the entire AD which can be queried using BloodHound. Do the following:

* [Install neo4j](https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/how-do-i-enable-remote-https-access-with-neo4j-30x/) [Community Edition](https://neo4j.com/download/community-edition/) manually from their [website](https://neo4j.com/download/?ref=hro) , not through apt.
* [http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/\#releases](http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/#releases)
* [A guide on installing can be found here](https://stealingthe.network/quick-guide-to-installing-bloodhound-in-kali-rolling/)
* Run neo4j from `/opt/neo4j-community-3.3.0/bin/neo4j start`
* Navigate to localhost:7474 in your browser.
* Set a new password for the neo4j account.
* Edit neo4j.conf and set the following parameters to make any host be able to access the database.
  ```
  dbms.connector.http.enabled=true
  dbms.connector.http.listen_address=0.0.0.0:7474
  ```
* Restart neo4j with  `/opt/neo4j-community-3.1.1/bin/neo4j restart`
* Access neo4j in the browser at `http://0.0.0.0:7474/browser/`

##### Neo4j on Windows
Neo4j can be started with powershell on windows.
* Spawn an administrative powershell with -bypass exec
* Navigate to the neo4j/bin directory
* `Import-Module .\Neo4j-Management.psd1`

* `Invoke-Neo4j Console`
* Likewise to Linux, log in to localhost:7474 and change the password.

##### Neo4j on Mac
Similar procedure as linux. Neo4j does not support Java 9, so Java SDK must be version 8 and not 9 \(neo4j not suppported\). So install java 8 with Homebrew
* `brew update`
* `brew cask install java8`



#### Back to Bloodhound

* Install BloodHound according to instructions on the [Github page](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/wiki/Getting-started)

* Launch BloodHound and log in to the neo4j database with credentials from before

The old method of ingesting, where file is dropped to disk:

```
powershell -exec bypass
Import-Module ./BloodHound.ps1
Invoke-BloodHound -URI http://SERVER:7474/ -UserPass "user:pass"
```

The new method:

```
scriptimport /path/to/powershell-script.ps1
scrimptcmd Invoke-BloodHound -URI http://SERVER:7474/ -UserPass "user:pass"
```

You should now see data being populated into the database and you can play with BloodHound to create really some really cool maps. You can also perform queries to show the shortest path to DA, etc.

Another method:

```
Powershell -exec bypass
Import-module SharpHound.ps1
Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod ACL,ObjectProps,Default -CompressData â€“SkipPing
```
