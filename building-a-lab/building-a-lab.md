# Building a lab

There are a few guides to building a lab in this book.

### Mini lab for children

The first lab guide helps you set up a very small and simple lab consisting of a domain controller and a few workstations. The goal is to practice credential relaying using Responder and other fun tools.

### Big boy labs for big boys

I have added an article for building a much bigger lab using ESXi and automating a lot of it with Vagrant. If you feel confident, brave and have a lot of time, go for this. It requires fundamental knowledge of setting up Active Directory and configuring Windows machines. It could be used as a companion lab for MCSA and MCSE certifications.

## Automated Lab

I've been playing with [AutomatedLab ](https://github.com/AutomatedLab/AutomatedLab)for a while using Hyper-V. More to come!
