### DeathStar
I love all the Star Wars references. DeathStar is a pretty new tool for automating the entire process of becoming DA.
[byt3bl33d3r has documented it on his Github](https://byt3bl33d3r.github.io/automating-the-empire-with-the-death-star-getting-domain-admin-with-a-push-of-a-button.html).


Basically, you run the NTLMrelay attack from the previous step, but with Empire set up with a REST API. Then you just run DeathStar, grab a coffee and come back as Domain Admin.

Note: I have had some trouble making DeathStar and Empire cooperate. There's a little explanation of why in the DeathStar Github page. Hopefully, it will be stable soon.
